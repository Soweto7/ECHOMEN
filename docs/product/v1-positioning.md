# ECHO v1 Positioning Brief

## Product Vision (v1)
ECHO is an execution-first AI product builder for solo founders and lean product teams who need to go from concept to a shippable app plan quickly.

## Target User Persona
**Primary persona: Solo technical founder (0–5 person team)**
- Ships side projects or early-stage SaaS products on nights/weekends.
- Comfortable with code, but constrained by time, context-switching, and launch planning overhead.
- Needs a structured path from fuzzy idea to concrete build and launch tasks.
- Success metric: reaches a deployable first release in days, not weeks.

## Top 3 Pain Points
1. **Idea-to-scope gap:** Users can describe what they want, but struggle to turn it into a sequenced implementation plan.
2. **Fragmented launch prep:** Architecture notes, setup tasks, code scaffolding, and launch checklist live in different tools with no single flow.
3. **Execution drift:** Initial momentum is lost because there is no guided, end-to-end workflow that keeps every output tied to launch readiness.

## ECHO's Unique Promise (Exact)
**ECHO turns a plain-English app idea into a deployment-ready build plan, code scaffold, and launch checklist in one guided run.**

## Hero Workflow (v1): Idea → Deployment-Ready Package

### End-to-end map
1. **Input the idea**
   - User enters app concept, target audience, and desired timeline in the command center.
2. **Clarify and scope**
   - ECHO refines the prompt and identifies core product scope, technical assumptions, and milestones.
3. **Generate execution plan**
   - ECHO outputs an ordered task pipeline with dependencies (what to build first, next, and last).
4. **Produce scaffold artifacts**
   - ECHO generates starter code and implementation artifacts aligned to the plan.
5. **Create launch checklist**
   - ECHO assembles deployment-readiness tasks (env config, QA pass, rollout checklist).
6. **Review outputs in one place**
   - User reviews artifacts panel and exports what is needed to begin build/deploy.

## v1 Scope Discipline
For v1, ECHO emphasizes one focused workflow (idea to deployment-ready package). UI options that do not advance this flow are hidden or de-emphasized to reduce cognitive load and increase completion rate.

## Messaging Guardrail
All landing copy and in-app empty states should reinforce the exact promise sentence above, without adding adjacent value propositions that imply broader chat-first use cases.
